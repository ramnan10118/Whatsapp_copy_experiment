# WhatsApp Copy Playbook — CTR Optimisation

## Message Structure
Every high-performing WhatsApp message follows this skeleton:
1. **Header** (bold): The interrupt hook — must earn the tap on its own
2. **Body**: 2–4 scannable lines — benefits, proof, participation mechanic
3. **CTA**: Single clear action — must match exactly what the user sees after tapping

## Header Rules — The Hook

The header is the most critical line. It appears in the notification preview. If it doesn't earn the tap, nothing else matters.

### Proven hook patterns (ranked by performance from past data):

**1. Direct Bold Claim** — State the offer clearly, no hedging
- "FREE CAR, no joke!" → 1.03% CTR (afternoon), 0.80% CTR (morning)
- "A FREE CAR! Yup, that's right!" → 1.00% CTR (afternoon), 0.65% CTR (morning)
- Works across time slots. Consistent and reliable.
- The key: name the thing directly. "FREE CAR" not "something amazing".

**2. Exclusivity Frame** — Signal it's specifically for them
- "Important: For ACKO customers" → 1.14% CTR — best single performer (morning)
- "Important:" signals utility, not marketing — bypasses the promotional filter in users' minds
- Works best in morning slots (9–11 AM) when people scan for important notifications
- The exclusivity must be real — don't fake it

**3. Exclusivity + Direct Claim Combo**
- Header: direct claim → Body: reinforces exclusivity ("Only for ACKO Car Insurance customers")
- Reliable pattern that performs well across both time slots

**4. Curiosity Gap — Use with Caution**
- Only works if the body immediately resolves the curiosity with a clear benefit
- "Wait….a FREE car just dropped!" → 0.59% CTR (acceptable)
- Vague curiosity without fast payoff consistently underperforms

### Hook patterns to AVOID:
- **Social comparison**: "What if your neighbour wins?" → 0.26% CTR — worst performer
- **Vague mystery**: "What's happening on ACKO Drive? 👀" → 0.32% CTR
- **Overhyped clickbait**: "This surprise broke the internet!" → 0.45% CTR
- **Too-good-to-be-true framing**: "Click once… and win a car" → 0.43% CTR (sounds scammy)
- **Emotional affinity without value**: "We really like you at ACKO!" → 0.43% CTR
- **Announcement-style**: "Attn. FREE Car for ACKO users" → 0.69% CTR (lower than direct claim)
- **Luck framing without a benefit**: "Today looks lucky⚡" → 0.40% CTR
- **Hedged claims**: "you might win", "give it a shot" signals low stakes

## Body Rules
- Maximum 3–4 lines. Each line must be independently skimmable.
- Lead with the clearest benefit on the first line.
- Use ✅ ⚡ or • for lists of 3+ items.
- One idea per line.
- Do not repeat the header — build on it.
- If exclusivity was in the header, reinforce it early in the body.
- The participation mechanic ("Just 3 quick steps", "Wishlist 3 cars") reduces perceived effort — include it.

## CTA Rules
- Exactly 1 CTA per message. Never 2.
- Action-forward language: "Book your slot", "Tap to enter", "Register here", "Tap to see how"
- CTA must match the landing page intent — if the page is a booking form, the CTA says "Book", not "Learn more"
- **Avoid generic CTAs**: "Click here", "Know more", "Find out more" — too vague
- No emojis in CTA

## Message Length
- Header: 30–60 characters (optimal for notification preview)
- Body: 40–120 characters across 3–4 lines
- Total message: under 300 characters where possible

## Time Slot Playbook

**9–11 AM (Morning)**
- Best performer: Exclusivity framing ("Important: For ACKO customers")
- People scan notifications for things that feel personally relevant and important
- Personalization signals drive taps in this window

**1–2 PM (Afternoon)**
- Best performer: Direct bold claim ("FREE CAR, no joke!")
- People are in decision mode during lunch hours
- Lead with the clearest possible value statement

**Images**
- Image attachments did NOT significantly improve CTR in tested campaigns
- A message with image got 1.00% CTR; same message without image got 1.03% CTR
- Copy quality matters more than visual assets for WhatsApp

## The 3-Second Skim Test
Before finalising any message:
1. Is the main benefit visible in the first line?
2. Can you understand the whole offer in 3 seconds?
3. Does it sound like a human texted this, not a company?
4. Is the CTA exactly what the user will see after tapping?
