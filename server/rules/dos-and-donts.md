# WhatsApp Copy — Dos and Don'ts

## Required Elements by Campaign Type

### Contest / Giveaway Campaigns
- Clear prize description in header or first body line
- Participation mechanic (what does the user need to do? Keep it to ≤3 steps)
- Eligibility signal (who can participate — exclusivity helps CTR)
- CTA that goes directly to the registration/participation flow

### Service Campaigns (ACKO Drive)
- Specific service name (e.g., "full car health check", not just "service")
- Price if an offer exists — specificity builds trust
- Pickup & drop mention if applicable — this is high perceived value for users
- Booking CTA that goes directly to the booking flow, not a homepage

### Renewal / Expiry Campaigns
- Approximate expiry context (not exact date unless personalized)
- Brief consequence of not renewing — factual, not fearmongering
- Direct renewal CTA

## Language Don'ts

- ❌ "Dear Customer" / "Greetings" / "Kindly" / "Please be informed" / "As per our records"
- ❌ Passive voice — use "You're selected" not "You have been selected"
- ❌ ALL CAPS entire sentences
- ❌ Triple exclamation marks (!!!)
- ❌ "100% guaranteed" or absolute promise language
- ❌ Competitor mentions
- ❌ Misleading urgency — "Offer ends TODAY" only if it actually does
- ❌ "might", "perhaps", "maybe" in the header — hedged language signals low stakes
- ❌ "Click here" or "Know more" as CTA — too vague

## Formatting Don'ts

- ❌ URLs in message body — use CTA button only
- ❌ Emojis in CTA button text
- ❌ More than 3 emojis total in one message
- ❌ Asterisks used for bold in body text (use sparingly — WhatsApp renders *text* as bold)
- ❌ Line breaks that make the message feel like a document, not a chat

## Patterns That Underperform (Based on Past Data)

These are patterns we've tested and confirmed fail — do not use them:

| Pattern | CTR | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Social comparison hook | 0.26% | Creates anxiety not action; feels manipulative |
| Vague mystery/curiosity | 0.32% | No perceived value before tapping |
| Overhyped viral language | 0.45% | "Broke the internet" feels like low-quality clickbait |
| Luck framing without benefit | 0.40% | Vague; no clear reason to tap |
| Emotional affinity hook | 0.43% | "We really like you" feels insincere and unearned |
| Skepticism-confirming hook | 0.43% | "Sounds impossible, right?" confirms doubt, doesn't overcome it |
| Corporate announcement style | 0.69% | "Attn." prefix feels like mass broadcast, not personal |

## Compliance Red Flags

- ❌ Guaranteed wins or guaranteed returns
- ❌ Pure promotional language in a message categorized as utility (gets flagged by WhatsApp)
- ❌ Any claim not backed by T&Cs
- ❌ "Limited time" without a specific timeframe
