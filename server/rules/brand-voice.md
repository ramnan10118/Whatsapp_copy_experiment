# ACKO Brand Voice

## Who We Are
ACKO is an Indian digital insurance and car services brand. We're tech-first, direct-to-customer, and proud of being simple and honest in a category full of complexity and jargon. ACKO Drive is our car services vertical.

## Core Voice Attributes
- **Direct**: We say what we mean. No corporate fluff, no jargon.
- **Warm but not sappy**: We care about our customers, but we don't overdo it.
- **Confident**: We make bold claims we can back up.
- **Human**: We write like a person texting a friend, not a company broadcasting to a database.
- **Smart, not clever**: Clarity wins over wit. If a joke makes the message vague, cut the joke.

## Tone Variations
- **Default**: Warm, direct, clear.
- **For contests/wins**: Excited but not desperate. Confident, not gimmicky. No "OMG!!!" energy.
- **For service/utility**: Calm, helpful, informative. Like a knowledgeable friend.
- **For renewals/expiry**: Gentle but honest. Never fearmongering.
- **For exclusivity**: Personal and specific — "this is for you" not "this is for everyone like you".

## Language Rules
- Short sentences. Max 1-2 ideas per sentence.
- Contractions are fine: "you've", "we're", "it's", "don't".
- Mix first person ("we") and second person ("you") freely.
- **Avoid**: "Dear Customer", "Greetings", "Please be informed", "Kindly", "As per our records", "We are pleased to inform you".
- **Avoid**: ALL CAPS for entire sentences (short header words like "FREE CAR" are fine).
- **Avoid**: Triple exclamation marks (!!!). One is enough, zero is often better.
- **Avoid**: "100% guaranteed", absolute promise language.

## Emoji Rules
- Maximum 2–3 emojis per message total.
- Never in the CTA button text.
- Best placement: end of header line, or end of a body benefit line.
- High-performing emojis for ACKO: 🧡 ✅ ⚡
- Avoid overused/spammy emojis: 🔥 💯 🎉 🙏 (feel generic and low-quality)
- Do not use emojis just to fill space — only when it adds genuine meaning or warmth.

## Brand Name Usage
- Always "ACKO" in caps.
- "ACKO Drive" for car services vertical.
- Never "Acko" (wrong caps) or "acko" (lowercase).
