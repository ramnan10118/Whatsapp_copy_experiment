**Objective:** CTR → contest registration / participation

**Benchmark CTR:**

## ✅ HIGH CTR EXAMPLES

---

### Example 1
**Label:** HIGH CTR — BEST SINGLE PERFORMER
**CTR:** 1.14% | **Cohort:** ~3,300 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Exclusivity / Utility framing

**Header:** Important: For ACKO customers
**Body:** We're running a contest where you can win a brand NEW CAR! Tap here to register.
**CTA:** Tap here to register

**Why it worked:**
- "Important:" signals utility, not a promotional message — bypasses the "this is marketing" filter in users' minds and earns attention as if it's a service notification
- "For ACKO customers" creates immediate exclusivity and personalisation — this feels sent specifically to them, not mass broadcast
- Body is direct: "you can win" not "you might win" — confident, not hedged
- Morning slot amplifies the exclusivity frame — people scan 9–11 AM notifications for things that feel personally important
- Note: Same message dropped to 0.80% CTR in afternoon batch — this framing is particularly strong in morning

---

### Example 2
**Label:** HIGH CTR — MOST CONSISTENT PERFORMER
**CTR:** 1.03% (afternoon) | 0.80% (morning) | **Cohort:** ~87,000 (PM) / ~3,200 (AM) | **Time:** Both slots
**Tone:** Direct Claim — bold, no hedging

**Header:** FREE CAR, no joke!
**Body:** We are giving away a brand new car absolutely FREE! To participate, tap and wishlist your favourite cars.
**CTA:** Tap and wishlist

**Why it worked:**
- Header makes the boldest possible direct claim and immediately handles the skepticism objection with "no joke!" — this preempts disbelief before it forms
- No vagueness about what's on offer — free car is stated twice (header + body) for emphasis
- "no joke!" is conversational and human — doesn't sound corporate
- Consistent performer across both time slots — most reliable pattern in this campaign
- Key lesson: state the prize clearly and handle skepticism in the same line

---

### Example 3
**Label:** HIGH CTR
**CTR:** 1.00% | **Cohort:** ~88,000 | **Time:** 1–2 PM | Image attached
**Tone:** Direct Claim + Exclusivity reinforcement

**Header:** A FREE CAR! Yup, that's right!
**Body:** Only for ACKO Car Insurance customers. Just 3 quick steps. Tap to see how 🧡
**CTA:** Tap to see how

**Why it worked:**
- Header: direct claim. Body: immediately reinforces exclusivity ("Only for ACKO Car Insurance customers")
- "Just 3 quick steps" reduces perceived effort — lowers barrier to action by signaling it's easy
- 🧡 adds warmth at the end without being gimmicky
- Image was attached but CTR (1.00%) was virtually identical to the no-image version — copy drove the result, not the visual
- Combining direct claim in header with exclusivity in body is a reliable high-CTR structure

---

### Example 4
**Label:** HIGH CTR
**CTR:** 0.65% | **Cohort:** ~3,400 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Direct Claim + Exclusivity

**Header:** A FREE CAR! Yup, that's right!
**Body:** Only for ACKO Car Insurance customers. Just 3 quick steps. Tap to see how 🧡
**CTA:** Tap to see how

**Why it worked:**
- Same message as Example 3, earlier time slot
- Performs well in both AM and PM — the direct claim + exclusivity reinforcement structure is time-slot agnostic
- Note: Exclusivity frame in the *header* (Example 1) outperforms exclusivity in the *body* in morning slots

---

## ⚠️ MID CTR EXAMPLES (Reference — Not Ideal)

---

### Example 5
**Label:** MID CTR
**CTR:** 0.60% | **Cohort:** ~3,300 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Energy / Competition

**Header:** Car wars
**Body:** The race is on to win a brand new car for FREE. Tap here and participate in the ACKO Drive Car Drop today!
**CTA:** Tap here

**Notes:** "Car wars" is energetic but abstract — doesn't communicate the offer in the header. Body clarifies, but some users will have dropped off at the header before reading the body. Lesson: the header must communicate value on its own.

---

### Example 6
**Label:** MID CTR
**CTR:** 0.59% | **Cohort:** ~3,400 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Curiosity with fast payoff

**Header:** Wait….a FREE car just dropped!
**Body:** Yup. ACKO Drive is giving one away. Tap, wishlist cars, and you can win it!
**CTA:** Tap and enter

**Notes:** Curiosity hook works here because the body resolves it immediately ("Yup. ACKO Drive is giving one away"). Still underperforms vs direct claim/exclusivity approaches. Acceptable pattern when used with immediate payoff.

---

### Example 7
**Label:** MID CTR
**CTR:** 0.54% | **Cohort:** ~3,300 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Direct announcement

**Header:** We're giving away a FREE CAR!
**Body:** Just wishlist 3 of your favourite cars and participate in the ACKO DRIVE CAR DROP. Tap to get started.
**CTA:** Tap to get started

**Notes:** Decent but the header is "we're giving" not "you can win" — slightly less personal. Also "ACKO DRIVE CAR DROP" in all caps feels like a logo/campaign name, not a message.

---

### Example 8
**Label:** MID CTR
**CTR:** 0.82% | **Cohort:** ~88,000 | **Time:** 1–2 PM
**Tone:** Direct Claim

**Header:** FREE CAR, no joke!
**Body:** We are giving away a brand new car absolutely FREE! To participate, tap and wishlist your favourite cars.
**CTA:** Tap and wishlist

**Notes:** Same message as Example 2 but different send batch in afternoon. 0.82% vs 1.03% for the same message — send timing and batch variation can affect CTR even for identical copy.

---

### Example 9
**Label:** MID CTR
**CTR:** 0.80% | **Cohort:** ~88,000 | **Time:** 1–2 PM | Image attached
**Tone:** Exclusivity / Utility

**Header:** Important: For ACKO customers
**Body:** We're running a contest where you can win a brand NEW CAR! Tap here to register.
**CTA:** Tap here to register

**Notes:** The top morning performer (1.14%) dropped to 0.80% in the afternoon batch. Exclusivity framing loses its edge in afternoon vs direct claim. Always preference direct bold claim for afternoon sends.

---

## ❌ LOW CTR EXAMPLES — NEVER REPEAT THESE PATTERNS

---

### Example 10
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID | WORST PERFORMER IN CAMPAIGN
**CTR:** 0.26% | **Cohort:** ~3,400 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Social comparison / FOMO
**Avoid because:** Social comparison triggers resistance and anxiety, not action. "What if your neighbour wins?" creates a negative emotional frame (fear of losing) but provides no positive incentive. Users feel manipulated, not motivated.

**Header:** What if your neighbour wins?
**Body:** You've got the same chance! Wishlist 3 cars and enter the ACKO Drive Car Drop before it closes.
**CTA:** Enter now

---

### Example 11
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID
**CTR:** 0.32% | **Cohort:** ~3,400 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Vague mystery / curiosity without payoff
**Avoid because:** "What's happening?" promises a reveal but doesn't signal any value before tapping. Users have no reason to believe the answer is worth their time. Curiosity hooks only work when there's a benefit hint — pure mystery fails.

**Header:** What's happening on ACKO Drive? 👀
**Body:** A drop so big, car lovers can't stop talking about it! Tap to see the surprise.
**CTA:** Tap to see

---

### Example 12
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID
**CTR:** 0.36% | **Cohort:** ~3,400 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Indirect question
**Avoid because:** "Want another car?" is a weak question hook — it implies a high-effort or expensive action ("getting a car") and gives no signal that it's free or easy. Users assume it's an ad.

**Header:** Want another car?
**Body:** You can get it for FREE! Just by participating in the ACKO Drive Car Drop. Tap to get started.
**CTA:** Tap to get started

---

### Example 13
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID
**CTR:** 0.40% | **Cohort:** ~3,300 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Luck framing / low-stakes
**Avoid because:** "Give it a shot?" sounds casual and low-stakes. "you might win" is hedged. Combined, these signals suggest the odds are bad and the prize isn't real. Headers must sound confident about the offer.

**Header:** Give it a shot? 🍀
**Body:** Join the ACKO Drive Car Drop and you might win a NEW CAR for FREE! Tap to enter.
**CTA:** Tap to enter

---

### Example 14
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID
**CTR:** 0.40% | **Cohort:** ~3,300 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Luck framing / vague
**Avoid because:** "Today looks lucky" is generic — it could be any promotional message from any brand. Doesn't communicate what the offer is. Emoji (⚡) doesn't help if the words are vague.

**Header:** Today looks lucky⚡
**Body:** You've got one car - maybe you can WIN another. Join the ACKO Drive Car Drop and give luck a chance.
**CTA:** Join now

---

### Example 15
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID
**CTR:** 0.43% | **Cohort:** ~3,300 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Too-good-to-be-true / skepticism-confirming
**Avoid because:** "Click once… and win a car" sounds scammy. "Sounds impossible, right?" is the single worst move — it confirms the user's skepticism rather than overcoming it. Never put the user's doubt into words.

**Header:** Click once… and win a car
**Body:** Sounds impossible, right? That's exactly what makes the ACKO Drive Car Drop so wild. Tap and join now.
**CTA:** Join now

---

### Example 16
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID
**CTR:** 0.43% | **Cohort:** ~3,300 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Emotional affinity
**Avoid because:** "We really like you at ACKO!" feels manufactured and insincere. Emotional affinity without a concrete benefit attached performs poorly. Users see through it as a setup for a promotional message.

**Header:** We really like you at ACKO!
**Body:** So, here's a chance for you to WIN A NEW CAR!!! All you have to do is tap and wishlist 3 cars.
**CTA:** Tap and wishlist

---

### Example 17
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID
**CTR:** 0.45% | **Cohort:** ~3,400 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Overhyped viral language
**Avoid because:** "This surprise broke the internet!" is overused, vague, and feels like low-quality clickbait. 😱 emoji reinforces the overdramatic tone. "Tap to know more" is also a weak CTA with no benefit signal.

**Header:** This surprise broke the internet!
**Body:** No one expected ACKO Drive to drop this. Tap to know more 😱
**CTA:** Tap to know more

---

### Example 18
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID
**CTR:** 0.45% | **Cohort:** ~3,100 | **Time:** 9–11 AM
**Tone:** Bollywood reference / cultural hook
**Avoid because:** "Oye Lucky! Lucky oye!" is a cultural reference that may not land universally. "Time to test your luck!" frames the offer as luck-dependent, which lowers perceived odds.

**Header:** Oye Lucky! Lucky oye!
**Body:** Time to test your luck! Tap here, wishlist 3 cars, and you might win a brand new car from ACKO Drive.
**CTA:** Tap here

---

### Example 19
**Label:** LOW CTR — AVOID (relative underperformer in its batch)
**CTR:** 0.69% | **Cohort:** ~88,000 | **Time:** 1–2 PM
**Tone:** Corporate announcement
**Avoid because:** "Attn." prefix makes it feel like a corporate broadcast, not a personal message. In the afternoon batch, this underperformed the direct claim by ~0.34 percentage points despite identical audience size.

**Header:** Attn. FREE Car for ACKO users
**Body:** ACKO car policyholders, this one's for you! Your chance to win a brand-new car starts here.
**CTA:** Start here
